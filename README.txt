Add Transport For London (TFL) travel information and/or a Tube map to your pages quickly and easily with these shortcodes.

== Description ==

Now with Widget support!!!

TFL Widgets lets you add Transport For London widgets to your pages using WordPress "shortcodes" or as a WordPress Widget. 

Simply install the plugin, then you can add the shortcodes into pages/posts as follows:

#### Tube service updates

Live travel news for the Tube, updated every minute.

* `[tube-updates]` - Gives live Tube service updates 240px wide (default).
* `[tube-updates width="500px"]` - Gives live Tube service updates 500px wide, you can also use any valid CSS width units: %, em etc.
* `[tube-updates width="variable"]` - Gives live Tube service updates of variable width which stretches to fit its container.

#### Tube map

Draggable Tube map, with integrated station search.

* `[tube-map]` - Gives a Tube map 360px wide (default).
* `[tube-map width="500px"]` - Gives a Tube map 500px wide, you can also use any valid CSS width units: %, em etc.
